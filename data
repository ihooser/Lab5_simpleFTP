Minute paper one:
	In the first lecture of the semester, the most significant thing that I learned was the doubling of the price and the size of devices. This is huge because the smaller the size of the transistor or of the other devices the smaller the entire product will be. The decrease of the price of the devices are also very important for all of the consumers buying it. A good example of this is the personal computer. It originally started out as the size of a room. Now it is much faster, it holds more information and it fits into the palm of a hand. Because more and more people have a computer or a phone this has also increased the amount of IP traffic that is used. As you stated in class the IP traffic will continue to grow by 3X over the next 5 years.
	The biggest question on my mind is, how far can we, as humans, push the limit of how fast and small we can make the devices? Eventually transistors, capacitors, and other element will hit a wall of how small that they can get. This will also be true to the fact that we will only get so far on how fast we can get our devices to go. You did talk about the expectation of how fast a device should work, but what will our expectations change to in the future?

Minute paper two:
	This lecture taught me a lot about how encrypted information is sent. I had no idea how this worked before this lecture. I can see how the importance of having encrypted information being sent. The military needs to be able to do this to keep what they are doing safe and also they need to keep locations and personal safe. If it was easy to intercept information then a lot of bad things can happen. The way that the encryption happens is also very important. If it is believed that the encryption isnâ€™t good enough then you can always add another key and another encryption. This lecture was also the first time that I had heard about DES encrypting. It has a lot of levels for protections and there is no known back door. Another thing that was important in this lecture was that the sampling frequency needs to be twice the frequency that is being sampled.
	The biggest question on my mind right now is the fact that the key to decode the cipher sent through a secured line. How is that line secured? Is it sent through another cipher and has a different key, or is there another special way that this key is sent to the receiving end.
